This virtual lab contains interactive exercises to study the design of linear and adaptive model predictive controllers (MPCs) for implementing a vehicle steering control system.

The lab solutions are available upon instructor request. If you would like to request solutions, find an issue, or have a suggestion, contact us [here](https://forms.office.com/r/00RBNtyyj2).

## Learning Goals
- Model and simulate lateral vehicle dynamics
- Design a linear MPC controller for the vehicle steering control system
- Design an adaptive MPC controller for the vehicle steering control system
- Bonus: Create custom trajectory and/or learn about methods for improved controllers

## Setup 
To get started with the MPC virtual lab, double-click the MPCVirtualLab.prj file inside MATLAB™. Then open up the MPC_virtual_lab.mlx live script, where you'll find the instructions for running the interactive exercises to complete the virtual lab.

## Suggeted Prework
- [MPC Tech Talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U0xiOkDcmw&list=PLn8PRpmsu08ozoeoXgxPSBKLyd4YEHww8) help students gain insights into why engineers use Model Predictive Control, how they work and the difference between linear and non-linear Model Predictive Control.
